# Bounce

This project i created for the bounce hackathon 1.0 , me and my team mate took part in it and we reached the top 12 and unfortunately didnt win.
Our project was majorly data science oriented and this application was to show the implementatio of that model. In this application i have made
use of Google maps integration and fetching the current location and placing custom marker on custom location. Also this project has the implementation 
of bottom sheet in android and how a bottom sheet can communicate with the underlaying activty. 

I hope this repository helps the commnity in any way. 
Thank you.
